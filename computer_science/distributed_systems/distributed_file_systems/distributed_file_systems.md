# Distributed File Systems

## Why are distributed file systems hard?
Distributed systems need performance

* Performance `fixedBy` Sharding
* Sharding `fixedBy` Faults
* Faults `fixedBy` Tolerance 
* Tolerance `fixedBy` Replication 
* Replication `fixedBy` Inconsistencies
* Inconsistencies `fixedBy` Low performance
* Low performance `fixedBy` mitigate with Probabilistic Bounded Staleness
