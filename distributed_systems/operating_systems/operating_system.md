## Operating System
Networking versus Distributed OS

**Networked OS**

A networked operating system provides support for network operations. The users manage the networked applications and commands. 
Each host is autonomous. 

**Distributed OS**

Tries to abstract the network from the user and thereby remove the need for the user to specify how the networking commands and operations should be undertaken.
