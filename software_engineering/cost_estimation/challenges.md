## Challenges in cost estimation.
* There is no exact science for cost estimation - it will never be considered as all accurate.
* No person can reasonably predict what can go wrong in the project.
* Most estimation methods assume things will proceed as expected and simply adds some slack to account for what can go wrong. 

### Possible solutions
* Delay estimation - 100% accuracy but less usefull
* Base estimation on data from previous projects that have been completed.
* Break the system to smaller parts and generate the estimates for smaller parts, which is easier. 
* Use emperically-based estimation methods.
