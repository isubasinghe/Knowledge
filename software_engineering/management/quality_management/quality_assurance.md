## Quality Assurance

The establishment of a framework of organizational procedures and standards that lead to high quality software.
There are two types:

- Product standards: These applies to the product being developed
- Process standards: These standards define the processes that should be followed during software development

|        Product Standards        |       Process Standards       |
| :-----------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
|   Design review from template   |     Design review conduct     |
| Requirements document structure |   Design validation process   |
|     Documentation standards     |    Version release process    |
|   Coding standards to follow    | Project plan approval process |
|       Project plan format       |    Change control process     |
|  Change request from template   |    Test recording process     |

### Advantage of standards

- Provide a framework around which quality assurance process may be implemented
- Provide encapsulation of best, or least most appropriate, practice.
- Customers sometimes require a particular quality standard/level when choosing a software vendor.

### Disadvantages of standards

- Not seen as relevant and up to date by software engineers
- Involve too much bureaucratic form filling
- Unsupported by software tools so tedius manual work is involved to maintain standards
