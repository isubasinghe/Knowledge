## Earned Value Analysis (EVA)

- Eva can be used to:
  - report current/past project performance
  - predict future project performance based on current/past performance
- Results can be expressed in dollars and/or performance

### Planned Value (PV)

The portion of the approved cost estimate planned to be spent on the given activity during a given period.

### Earned Value

The value of the work actually completed

### Actual Cost

The total costs incurred in accomplishing work on the activity in a given period

### Example

You are assigned to manage a project that is planned to finish in 12 months, estimated to cost $100,000. 
At the end of the third month, based on the project Gannt chart, 20% of the work has been completed. The finance department
has reported the cost of the project to date as $35,000.

PV = ($100_000\*3)/12 = \$25_000
EV = ($100_000\*20)/100 = \$20_000
AC = \$35_000
