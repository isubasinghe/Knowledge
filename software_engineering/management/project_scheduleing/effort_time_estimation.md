## Effort-time estimation

A common measure for estimating the effort for software is **man-months**

### The mythical man-month

- man-months is a misleading measure to estimate software.
- adding people to a project that is behind schedule could result in more damage than helping it.

### Time Estimation

- optimistic time _O_
- pessimistic time _P_
- most likely time _M_
- expected time _TE_

TE = ( _O_ + 4\*_M_ + _P_)/6
