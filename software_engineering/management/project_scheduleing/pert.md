## PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) chart

### PERT charts help

- Understand the characteristics of the project that will let project managers do scheduling trade-offs
- Perform critical path analysis
- Monitor project progress and re-plan

### PERT charts

Involves calculating the following estimates

- Earliest start time (ES)
- Latest start time (LS)
- Earliest finish time (EF)
- Latest finish time (LF)
- Slack time

### Critical path

- Path with longest duration
- Activities on the critical path have a total free slack of zero
- A delay in any of the activities in the critical path will cause the project to delay

### Crashing the critical path

- Shortening the total duration of the project by shortening the critical path by
  - Removing dependencies between activities in the critical path
  - Shortening the duration of activities in the critical path
