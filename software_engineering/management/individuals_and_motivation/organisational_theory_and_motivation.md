## Hertzberg two factor model

* Proposed by Frank Hertzberg
* Asked people to describe situations when they felt really good and really bad about their jobs.&#x20;
* There are a set of factors in the workplace that cause satisfaction.&#x20;
* And a seperate set of factors that cause dissatisfaction.&#x20;
* Remedying the causes of dissatisfaction will not create satisfaction

* Base wage,salary

### Job satisfaction

* Achievement
