# Teams and teamwork

## What is a team ?

* An individual is a person with unique skills. 
* A group is a collection of people working together who do not necessarily work collectively toward the same goal. 
* A team is two or more individuals consciously working together to achieve a common objective. 
* A group becomes a team when members demonstrate a commitment to each other and to the end goal toward which they are working. 

## Why teams?
