## Function Points
Is used to express the amount of functionality in a software system, as seen by the user.
A higher number of function points indicates more functionality. 
Typically used to:
  - Estimate the cost and effort required to design, code and test a software system.
  - Predict the number of errors
  - Predict the number of components
  - Measure productivity
Function Points are computed from the Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

### Advantages of function points
* Measure the size of the solution instead of the size of the problem 
* Requirements are the only thing needed for function points count
* Can be estimated early in analysis and design 
* Is independant of technology 
* Is independant of programming languages

### Disadvantages of function points
* A well defined requirements specification is necessary
* Gaining proficency is not easy, the learning curve is quite long
* Could be quite time-consuming this could be costly
