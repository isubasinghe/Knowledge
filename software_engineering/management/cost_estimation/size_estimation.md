# Size Estimation

Commonly used metric for software size estimation

* Source lines of code \(SLOC\)
* Function Points \(FP\)
  * Based on Requirement specs
* Use case points \(UCP\)
  * Based on Use Cases

## Source Lines of Code \(SLOC\)

There are two types of SLOC:

* Physicial SLOC: Count excluding comments and blank lines.
* Logical SLOC: Measure the number of executable "statements", but their specific definitions are tied to specific computer languages. 

### Advantages of SLOC

* Scope for Automation of counting: since lines of code is a physical entity it is easy to count and can be automated using a tool. 
* An intuitive metric: Lines of code serves as an intuitive metric for measuring the size of software because it can be seen and the effect of it can be visualized. 

### Disadvantages of SLOC

* Variability: depends on programmer experience, language, framework support, reuse etc.
* It is difficult to estimate the number of lines of code that will be needed to develop a system from information that is available in analysis and design phases
* Lack of universally accepted definition for exactly what a line of code is.
