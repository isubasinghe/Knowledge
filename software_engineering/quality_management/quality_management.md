## Quality management

### What is quality? 
Quality is not an act, it is a habbit
It must be built into the system from the start

#### End user's persepective
Typically, end-users judge the quality of a product by their interaction with it.
These are **external quality characteristics**

#### Developer's persepective
Code cleanliness, performance, etc. 
These are **internal quality characteristics**

### Cost of quality

#### Some claim: 
Most quality assurance activities are too costly - savings made from not using resources is greater than the cost in fixing faults.
Empirical studies refute the above claim
