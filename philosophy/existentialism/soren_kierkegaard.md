## Soren Kierkegaard
> I opened my eyes and saw the real world - and I began to laugh and I haven't stopped since. 

## Meaningless
Laugh at the world's foolishness and you'll regret it, 
cry at the world's foolishness and you'll regret it. 
**The ony intelligent response to life's horror is to laugh at it**


## The Concept of Anxiety
Life can only be understood backwards, but made forwards.
Our constant angst mean unhappiness is more or less written into the script of life.
