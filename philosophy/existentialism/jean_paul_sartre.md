## Jean-Paul Sartre


## The absurdity of the world
Everything is absurd. 
Imagine dinner with your partner. 
A Sartrian would see this as such:
When your planet has turned away from a distant hyrdogen 
explosion, you put your knees under a slab of carbon
and put dead mammals and plants in your mouth while another mammal is 
doing the same beside you.


## We are Free
The absurdity is in itself liberating, we have true freedom. 
Everything is possible, we can cast away any shackles. 

## Bad Faith
We are in bad faith when we force ourselves to do something that we do
not want to do.
