## Speed of light
The speed of light is **c**,
but **c** is measured through entire return trip from point A to point B and back again.
It simply is not possible to have a one way measurement of the speed of light. 

This means that the following scenario could happen:
Lets define some variables:
    `c' := c/2`


`time(A,B) = c'`
`time(B,A) = âˆž`

Since the total return time equals to **c**, this is perfectly fine.
Physics does not break under the above scenario.
